## COMMAND-LINE BASICS

Ok--so here we're going to learn to talk to the computer.  We do this by typing commands into the "(Shell)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell]", which will then interpret these commands (it's a [command-line interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)) and then send instructions to the "[Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system))" (which you can think of as the very core of the computer--where all the stuff happens).  

To access the shell on your Mac, you open up the Terminal app, which you can find in your `~/Applications/Utilities` folder. You can also hit `command + space` to open up the spotlight search window and start typing in "Terminal" until you see it appear for you to click.

If you like the way your terminal looks (fonts, colors, etc)--cool. If not, hit `command + ,` 


### STEPS IN BRIEF
1. Open up Terminal.
2. Type some commands.
  - cd ~
  - ls
  - cd Development
  - ls
  - mkdir newDirectory
  - cd newDirectory
  - nano

## SCRIPTING

should we do .sh or .js?

pros of shell =
- extra layer of running through node not there.
