### NAVIGATING THE FILE SYSTEM

Much--**SO much**--of what you'll do in terminal involves navigating the file system (the sort of stuff you do in Finder on your Mac).
- To get started, type `pwd` (print working directory) to find the "path" of your current directory. This will show you the hierarchical list of folders and subfolders that shows (starting at the very root of your drive) where your directory is. The first character of each path will be `/`, which represents the root directory--it's like the place where the trunk of the tree meets the roots, right at the ground.  Everything else sprouts from there.  You'll probably see something like `/Users/llf`--with the `llf` being whatever your username is. This is the same username that shows up with a little circular photo when you log in to your mac.  
- To get a sense of the tree trunk and the branches, type in `cd /` and hit enter.  This will take you to the root of the tree trunk. Next, enter the two commands that you may as well enter EVERY TIME you follow one of the steps in this section:
  - Enter `ls` to see what's there.
  - Enter `pwd` to see where you are.  
This will help you get a better "pseudo-spatial" sense of where you're located, because without the cues offered by your Mac's GUI (Graphical User Interface), it can sometimes be difficult to know where you are.
- Now that you're in the root folder, let's find our way back to your own individual User folder, which is where all of YOUR stuff is going to be.  Enter `cd Users` to get into `/Users`, then once in `/Users`,   `cd llf` should get you into `/Users/llf`.
- Once in `/Users/llf`, your `ls` command should show you a bunch of folders you're pretty familiar with: they're the same folders you see frequently in the sidebar of your Mac's Finder. Most of the folders you see here were put there by Apple. But there's one folder that we in the Learning Lab put there for your use as a member of the codeLab team: "Development". Go ahead and type `cd Development` to get there. A quick `pwd` now should show you `/Users/llf/Development`, which is where you want to go at the beginning of nearly every work session here in the LL.

- One thing you may be wondering is whether the User folder is secure. Like, now that you know how to get to the `/Users` directory, what's to stop you from `cd`ing into a folder you're not supposed to be able to access? Well try it! You probably noticed that the `ll_master` directory was one of the options when you `ls`ed in the `/Users` folder. Let's go back and see if we can poke around there. This time let's get there by entering `cd ..`.  The `..` refers to the directory one step closer to the root than where we are.  We can refer to this directory as the "parent" directory of our current directory. Confusingly, people usually refer to this as one step "up" rather than "down"--inverting the tree metaphor! But if you are tempted to throw your arms up in exasperation and bemoan the code world's annoying counter-intuitiveness, think what you yourself might say if you were discussing a "Family Tree" rather than a plain old tree? Are your grand-parents two steps up from you or two steps down?
